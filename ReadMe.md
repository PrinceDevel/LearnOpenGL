## Creating Project
- Clone the project
- Since project uses premake you would have to download premake from <a href="https://premake.github.io/">Premake Website</a>
- Extract the zip and copy it in project
- using premake5 [exe] compile the code for your preferred tool
    - Visual Studio [ premake5 vs2022 ] [ premake5 vs2019 ] etc.
    - Gmake [ premake5 gmake2 ]

- You should be directly able to compile the solution Project
